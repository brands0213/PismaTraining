Prisma Schema Definitions

you can create a schema definitions or data model in schema.prisma file

We'll create a simple application with just a user with id and username and a post just like on facebook but simpler

username table : id and username
user post / Post table : id, title, post, created at, updated at, and user id

first we need to use model and then define the name of the table 

// model (table name) {

  | column | associated types |

}

// npx prisma migrate dev --name init
-it creates a new sql migration file for the contents or details of the migration
-it will look out to the schema.prisma file and then translate it to our database
